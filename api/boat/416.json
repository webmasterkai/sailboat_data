At this stage, 3 models were available: BERMUDA, MACKINAC and VINYARD.  Later they were built at the Seafarer plant on Long Island. As a result, one MERIDIAN often looks very different from another. An inboard was offered as an option on all models.","related-links":{"seafarer-research-center":{"link":"http://www.seafarer-research-center.com","text":"www.seafarer-research-center.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"422.32","e":"10.75' /  3.28m","est-forestay-len":"30.71' /  9.36m","i":"29.13' /  8.88m","j":"9.71' /  2.96m","p":"25.25' /  7.70m","sa-disp":"15.07","safore":"141.43 ft2 /  13.14 m2","samain":"135.72 ft2 /  12.61 m2","totalcalcsa":"277.14 ft2 /  25.75 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"15.06","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
