Columbia first built a small number of these as one-design racers. (The international 5.5 class ruled that they did not conform to their specifications and were banned from class events.) Later Columbia created this version with a trunk cabin and some cruising amenities which is called the SABRE.  A similar model was also built by Ericson, probably from this same mold, though it never achieved the same popularity.","related-links":{"columbia-yacht-owner-association":{"link":"http://www.columbia-yachts.com","text":"www.columbia-yachts.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"174.50","e":"13.50' /  4.11m","est-forestay-len":"30.28' /  9.23m","i":"28.75' /  8.76m","j":"9.50' /  2.90m","p":"31.00' /  9.45m","sa-disp":"20.36","safore":"136.56 ft2 /  12.69 m2","samain":"209.25 ft2 /  19.44 m2","totalcalcsa":"345.81 ft2 /  32.13 m2"},"rig-type":"Fractional  Sloop","sa-disp":"20.37","see-also":[{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=3130","text":"ERICSON 32 (SCORPION)"}}],"updated":"2014-09-01T04:16:02.387Z"}
