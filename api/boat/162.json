This was the ELECTRA, which had a masthead rig, a small, self-bailing cockpit, and a cabin with galley space, head and bunks. About 350 ELECTRAS were built over the next six years.\r\n\r\nPearson dealers surmised that prospective Electra buyers might prefer the boat with a larger cockpit and smaller cabin. They passed the information along to Pearson, who subsequently asked Alberg to design a day sailor, suitable for one-design racing, based on the ELECTRA hull.\r\n\r\nOther changes made included moving the mast six inches s forward, increasing the area of the mainsail, and reducing the height of the fore triangle. \r\n\r\nThe ELECTRA Day sailor, as it was first called, was an instant success: 219 were sold in the first year (1962). At this time, the first class racing was organized (Fleet #l, out of Larchmont, New York).\r\n\r\nThe next year saw 213 more boats built and nine more fleets formed - in Houston, Texas; Hingham, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Huntington and Port Washington, New York, Miami, Florida; Gibson Island, Maryland; and Falmouth, Maine.\r\nMost recent known builder (2003):\r\n\r\nEnsign Spars Inc.\r\n736 Scotland St.\r\nDunedin, Fl.  34698\r\n727-734-1837ph\r\n727-734-0880fx\r\n727-692-8061 mobile\r\nwww.ensignspars.com","related-links":{"ensign-class-usa":{"link":"http://www.ensignclass.com","text":"www.ensignclass.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"284.99","e":"11.12' /  3.39m","est-forestay-len":"26.10' /  7.96m","i":"25.00' /  7.62m","j":"7.50' /  2.29m","p":"25.50' /  7.77m","sa-disp":"18.16","safore":"93.75 ft2 /  8.71 m2","samain":"141.78 ft2 /  13.17 m2","totalcalcsa":"235.53 ft2 /  21.88 m2"},"rig-type":"Fractional  Sloop","sa-disp":"18.89","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=254","text":"ELECTRA (PEARSON)"}},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
