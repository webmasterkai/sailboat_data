A developement from the earlier CAL 46 MS. The differences between this and the earlier version: \r\nThe engine room has been moved forward to midships, the aft cabin moved further aft.  \r\nThe main salon and the forward cabin have been enlarged.  \r\nThis 'new' design, proved to be a huge success at the 1970 Long Beach Boat Show.  Ninety-five 2-46s were eventually built.\r\nThe boat went through a third iteration in the mid-'70s that included smaller cabin windows and a different interior layout. All the 46s were based on the same hull.","rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"253.97","e":"17.42' /  5.31m","est-forestay-len":"51.26' /  15.63m","i":"48.00' /  14.63m","j":"18.00' /  5.49m","p":"40.08' /  12.22m","sa-disp":"13.00","safore":"432.00 ft2 /  40.13 m2","samain":"349.10 ft2 /  32.43 m2","totalcalcsa":"781.10 ft2 /  72.56 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=2113","text":"CAL 46 MS"}},"tanks":{"fuel":"270 gals. /  1022 ltrs.","water":"170 gals. /  643 ltrs."},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
