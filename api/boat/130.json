Naval Academy and called the KNOCKABOUT. Including all variants, it is thought that around 500 hulls were built.\r\n(The first few boats were found to  be somewhat tender and ballast was increased to 1120 lbs.)\r\n(A small cruiser, the ANNAPOLIS 25 uses the RAINBOW hull with an entirely different different deck and coach  roof.
