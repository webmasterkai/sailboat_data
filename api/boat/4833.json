The first boat produced was given the name BOWMAN. The moulding was carried out by the Monachorum Manufacturing company.  Eleven boats were built by the Normand Boatyard before the rights were sold to their then agents Larry Baker and Alan Hallett of Emsworth Marine Sales. Some were also built at Emsworth Shipyard. \r\nLater, with some modifications, (longer coachroof and more freeboard) this design became the HURLEY 27.","rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"17.04","see-also":[{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=3293","text":"DOCKRELL 27"}}],"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
