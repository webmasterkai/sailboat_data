(The boat in the photo above may have been one of these!)\r\nSeveral were re-equipped by S&S with a lead shoe at the bottom of the keel, increasing the draft slightly but improving stability. In 1974 S&S designed a new keel which fitted onto the old bolt pattern, increasing the draft by 7\" and displacement by 700 lbs. Though this was offered as an option, most of the last 20 boats were delivered with this new keel and many earlier boats had them retro-fitted. \r\nThe molds were actually first created to build the TARTAN 43 and later adapted for the 41, which proved to be a far more popular model.","rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"228.53","e":"12.44' /  3.79m","est-forestay-len":"53.90' /  16.43m","i":"51.00' /  15.54m","j":"17.44' /  5.32m","p":"45.00' /  13.72m","sa-disp":"17.04","safore":"444.72 ft2 /  41.31 m2","samain":"279.90 ft2 /  26.00 m2","totalcalcsa":"724.62 ft2 /  67.32 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"17.05","tanks":{"water":"60 gals. /  227 ltrs."},"updated":"2014-09-01T04:15:31.978Z"}
