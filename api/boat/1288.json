In 1978 the boom was raised a foot. \r\nInitially, the Universal Atomic 4 gas engine came as standard equipment. The QM15 Yanmar Diesel eventually became an option, up to hull no. 675. The QM was superseded by the Yanmar 2GM beginning with no. 676; otherwise, the remaining changes were minor.The dinette table support changed from a vee support to a post; the windows changed from the original aluminum frame type to an integrated, smoked plexiglass unit glued directly into the cabin structure. In an attempt to find the ideal bushing for the rudder post, various types were incorporated into the rudder tube over the years; and various minute detailing changes were made throughout the boat, especially in interior teak detailing. \r\nAll 30s were built in Niagara on the Lake, Ontario.\r\nShallow draft version: 4.2'.","related-links":{"cc-yachts-photo-album":{"link":"http://www.cncphotoalbum.com","text":"www.cncphotoalbum.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"230.78","e":"11.50' /  3.51m","est-forestay-len":"41.27' /  12.58m","i":"39.00' /  11.89m","j":"13.50' /  4.11m","p":"34.00' /  10.36m","sa-disp":"18.41","safore":"263.25 ft2 /  24.46 m2","samain":"195.50 ft2 /  18.16 m2","totalcalcsa":"458.75 ft2 /  42.62 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"18.42","updated":"2014-09-01T04:16:48.371Z"}
