The first 69 boats were built by Soverel Marine in Florida. Republic Boats and Pacific Boat Works, both of California, contributed 5 and 19 boats respectively. The 1984 Republic boats all had flush decks with no coamings. By 1985, boats were being built at Pacific Boat Works. So for a short period of time time the boats were being built on both the east and west coasts. By 1986 both Pacific and Soverel had gone out of business. It is thought that, in total, about 90 boats were completed.","related-links":{"soverel-33-class-association":{"link":"http://www.soverel33.com","text":"www.soverel33.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"91.98","e":"13.00' /  3.96m","est-forestay-len":"44.39' /  13.53m","i":"42.50' /  12.95m","j":"12.80' /  3.90m","p":"41.00' /  12.50m","sa-disp":"26.77","safore":"272.00 ft2 /  25.27 m2","samain":"266.50 ft2 /  24.76 m2","totalcalcsa":"538.50 ft2 /  50.03 m2"},"rig-type":"Fractional  Sloop","sa-disp":"26.75","updated":"2014-09-01T04:10:38.997Z"}
