So, the 24, as well as the COLUMBIA CONTENDER 24, and COLUMBIA CHALLENGER 24, all derive from McGlasson�s wooden CATALINA ISLANDER from which the plug was made. The faux planking, that either remained from the original hull, or created artificially, which became an Islander trademark, was removed for the Columbia line.\r\nThough the original molds probably reside in a landfill somewhere, this hull design was 'recycled' by a number of other builders for many years.","related-links":{"columbia-yacht-owner-association":{"link":"http://www.columbia-yachts.com","text":"www.columbia-yachts.com"}},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"18.00","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
