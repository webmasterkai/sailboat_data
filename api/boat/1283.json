They share the same hull shape, exterior deck layout, and sailplan (displacement and ballast differ slightly).  \r\nThe first boats, built by G. deVries Lentch, Inc., have a permanantly-fixed cabin table with two leaves that fold down when not in use. At the aft end of the table is a hollow stainless pole that runs from the cabin sole to the bottom of the cabin ceiling, through which, runs a housing for the centerboard control cable. \r\nThe later model, mostly built by Royal Netherlands Aircraft, has a cabin table which completely folds away when not in use, as well as a new centerboard mechanism which operated by a control cable routed inside the port cabinetry. \r\nThe classic SWIFTSURE has bronze deck hardware and fittings, and mahogany trim. The deck hardware and fittings on the COMMODORE SWIFTSURE were constructed of stainless steel and aluminum, and teak trim.","rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"426.39","e":"14.70' /  4.48m","est-forestay-len":"40.81' /  12.44m","i":"38.73' /  11.80m","j":"12.87' /  3.92m","p":"34.18' /  10.42m","sa-disp":"15.77","safore":"249.23 ft2 /  23.15 m2","samain":"251.22 ft2 /  23.34 m2","totalcalcsa":"500.45 ft2 /  46.49 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"15.82","tanks":{"fuel":"28 gals. /  106 ltrs.","water":"60 gals. /  227 ltrs."},"updated":"2014-09-01T04:06:30.856Z"}
