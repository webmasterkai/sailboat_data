It is said that before the first (34 foot) boat hit the water, a second set of molds were created  for a 'stretched' version, first called the HANS CHRISTIAN 36, and later built as the UNION 36 among other names. Though the 36 foot version is still often considered a Robert Perry design, it was never authorized by him, nor were royalties ever paid.\r\nThanks to 34 owner Bill Lockwood (and others) for providing updated information.","rig-type":"Cutter","sa-disp":"15.04","tanks":{"fuel":"80 gals. /  303 ltrs.","water":"120 gals. /  454 ltrs."},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
