This from the SWEET SIXTEEN web site: \r\n\"A Demon hull was split medially from bow to stern. One of the half hulls was then place don a jig. The midline of the hull was faired medially with filler materially to form a new keel line. Through fiberglass and plastic surgery, the five feet three inches Demon beam was widened to six feet. Filler material was then sculpted forward n the flare of the hull to form the new bow, resulting in an overall length of sixteen feet, or nine inches longer than the Demon. The freeboard and shear were raised to accomplish symmetry, and a new top deck was designed for comfort and style. The resulting effort was the Sweet Sixteen.\"\r\nCharles Teeter was in-house designer and tool maker for Advance Sailboats Co.\r\nThanks to 'MacGyver' for additional information relating to the SWEET SIXTEEN.","related-links":{"sweet-sixteen-sailing-association":{"link":"http://www.s16.org","text":"www.s16.org"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"109.28","e":"9.00' /  2.74m","est-forestay-len":"15.66' /  4.77m","i":"15.00' /  4.57m","j":"4.50' /  1.37m","p":"18.50' /  5.64m","sa-disp":"31.92","safore":"33.75 ft2 /  3.14 m2","samain":"83.25 ft2 /  7.73 m2","totalcalcsa":"117.00 ft2 /  10.87 m2"},"rig-type":"Fractional  Sloop","sa-disp":"34.92","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
