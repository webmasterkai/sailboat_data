The earlier design (attached picture) includes a small forward hatch, plus a 3-stay rigging.  The Sailboatdata page (originally) lists these boats' manufacture starting in 1970.  However, the article I attached shows they have been around since at least 1965.  The Sailboatdata Topaz picture is the later design and includes a larger forward hatch area, a top-load lazarette, and a 6-stay rigging.\"","rig-type":"Fractional  Sloop","sa-disp":"23.25","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
