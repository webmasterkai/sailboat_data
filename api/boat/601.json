A year or so later, molds were shipped to J.J. Taylor and Sons Ltd. of Canada. In the first three years of production more than 300 boats were delivered.\r\nIn 1983, a number of modifications were made to the Canadian version. Gary Bannister, the principal partner of J.J. Taylor, re-designed the deck mold and some of the interior molds. To increase headroom, he lowered the floor by extending the aft end of the coach roof. Another hatch was added for increased light and ventilation. Some other changes included the addition of an anchor locker and changing for iron to lead ballast. Boats originally came with a 6.6 hp Peter gas engine as standard equipment.(later a 7 hp Farryman.)\r\nDiesel power was an option.  \r\nIn 1984, the Canadian version was renamed the TAYLOR 26 because of licencing disputes, even though, construction of the CONTESSA 26 in the UK ceased not long afterward when a fire destroyed the the original molds.\r\nAbout 400 Contessa and TAYLOR 26s were built in Canada, with the last boat delivered in 1990.\r\nThanks to Jeremy Rodgers Ltd. for providing information on all Contessa models.\r\nOther information pertaining to this particular yacht is from an article that appeared in 'Canadian Yachting' by Paul Howard.","related-links":{"contessa-corner-contessa-26":{"link":"http://www.co26.com/","text":"www.co26.com/"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"301.34","e":"8.50' /  2.59m","est-forestay-len":"30.36' /  9.26m","i":"29.00' /  8.84m","j":"9.00' /  2.74m","p":"24.00' /  7.32m","sa-disp":"12.12","safore":"130.50 ft2 /  12.12 m2","samain":"102.00 ft2 /  9.48 m2","totalcalcsa":"232.50 ft2 /  21.60 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"12.15","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=3532","text":"TAYLOR 26"}},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
