S&S design #1631. 'DAYSAILOR' is a designation used here for at least 2 versions of this yacht. There were actually 2 deck layouts and 2 accomodation plans offered, resulting in four models: CATALINA, NASSAU, NANTUCKET and MONHEGAN. The 'NANTUCKET' version, shown above, has a smaller cabin and longer cockpit. \r\nStern overhang seems to have varied between versions, (possibly to accommodate the outboard motor well). The original S&S design lists LOA as 22'. KESTREL seems to be an earlier name that Seafarer gave to this design.\r\nThe later SAILMASTER 22, by the same Dutch builder, but sold by another American company, is the same design though it was designed a new design number. (S&S#1743) \r\nFurther adding to the confusion is the later, American built SEAFARER 23, which is a completely different design.
