Intended to be an improvement on the 505 Dinghy. It is said the the original molds were destroyed in a factory fire after only 24 were built.\r\nThe other SPEARHEAD, was a development of the Goodricke type dinghy sailed in South Africa, designed and built by Frank Spears (& sons). (Also a high performance dinghy with trapeze.)\r\nIt became a one-design class in 1963 and raced as such into the mid-1980's.   It is possible that more than 200 were built. \r\nMore information on both these boats has been promised.","rig-type":"Frac.
