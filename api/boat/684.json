See FRISCO FLYER for what that boat looks like.\r\nAnother OFFSHORE 26, built of FG and introduced in 1969 appears to be a different design, possibly based on the NEWELL CADET, (also sold by Cheoy Lee as the OFFSHORE 27.)   \r\nNeither boat, under this name, appear to have been built in great numbers.","related-links":{"cheoy-lee-association-web-site":{"link":"http://www.cheoyleeassociation.com","text":"www.cheoyleeassociation.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"159.84","e":"11.50' /  3.51m","est-forestay-len":"34.24' /  10.44m","i":"32.75' /  9.98m","j":"10.00' /  3.05m","p":"28.50' /  8.69m","sa-disp":"19.29","safore":"163.75 ft2 /  15.21 m2","samain":"163.88 ft2 /  15.22 m2","totalcalcsa":"327.63 ft2 /  30.44 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"19.31","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=622","text":"FRISCO FLYER"}},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
