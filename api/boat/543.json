(At this time, William Shaw was an employee with S&S.) \r\nReportedly, O'Day Corp. farmed out the construction of this yacht to a number of different firms. The first was Lunn Laminates on LI, NY. ,(predecessor to Allied Yachts)., \r\nMarscot Plastics was an O'Day subsidiary located at Fall River, MA.\r\nA few may have been finished by J.J. Taylor of Canada. \r\nAn unknown number of boats were built with a wood deck and coachroof as a result of a fire which destroyed the deck molds. \r\nAnother version was soon being built by Yankee Yachts in California. See DOLPHIN 24 (YANKEE). The Palmer Huskie gas inboard was available as an option.","related-links":{"dophin-24-class-ss":{"link":"http://www.dolphin24.org","text":"www.dolphin24.org"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"276.62","e":"11.83' /  3.61m","est-forestay-len":"32.04' /  9.77m","i":"30.75' /  9.37m","j":"9.00' /  2.74m","p":"26.42' /  8.05m","sa-disp":"18.02","safore":"138.38 ft2 /  12.86 m2","samain":"156.27 ft2 /  14.52 m2","totalcalcsa":"294.65 ft2 /  27.37 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"18.16","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=457","text":"DOLPHIN 24 (YANKEE)"}},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
