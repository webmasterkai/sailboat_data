The first fibreglass versions were built by Cape North in Hong Kong, in the mid '70s, as the Cape North 43.   Later a Philippine firm obtained the molds and produced a few.\r\nThe CN 43s were good boats and several did well in prestigious ocean races in the '70s and '80s, including a China Sea Race fro HK to Manila.  Others survived some severe storms in the Atlantic on their way to Britain from the builders. The CN 43s seem to have been well built, under British management, but I have no idea of the quality of their Philippine sisterships.\"\r\nOwners plans can be purchased from Ted's Site shown above.","rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"253.08","e":"14.00' /  4.27m","est-forestay-len":"55.88' /  17.03m","i":"52.80' /  16.09m","j":"18.30' /  5.58m","p":"46.30' /  14.11m","sa-disp":"15.17","safore":"483.12 ft2 /  44.88 m2","samain":"324.10 ft2 /  30.11 m2","totalcalcsa":"807.22 ft2 /  74.99 m2"},"rig-type":"Staysail Ketch","sa-disp":"15.16","tanks":{"fuel":"90 gals. /  341 ltrs.","water":"180 gals. /  681 ltrs."},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
