For the updated model (called the CAL 2-46), the engine room was moved forward, the aft cabin even further aft. The main salon and the forward cabin were enlarged.  Bill Lapworth has stated that this was a favorite of all his designs and a yacht that he actually owned. The boat went through a third iteration in the mid-'70s that included smaller cabin windows and other changes to the interior. This was the CAL 3-46 (or \"Mark IIIs\"). All the 46s used the same hull.
