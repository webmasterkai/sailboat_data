Although from the same basic tooling, the OFFSHORE 40 has iron instead of lead ballast, and differences in other construction details. Sold as a sloop or yawl.\r\nIn the mid 1970's, Cheoy Lee Yard built another OFFSHORE 40 (variously designated as the OFFSHORE 4O MKII and then OFFSHORE 41), which was a different boat entirely and thought to be designed by Raymond Richards).
