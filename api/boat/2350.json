During this period, (between hull numbers 120 and 249) resin mixtures were changed to include an 'experimental' (fire-retardant?) additive.\r\nThis was thought to have cause the blistering that later appeared on many hulls, resulting in a class action law suit. \r\nUniflite went out of business in 1984.\r\nRich Worstell, a Valiant owner and dealer, bought the molds. After building some of the boats in Washington, he eventually moved the operation to Texas. (The first �Texas� VALIANT 40 was hull number 267). \r\nProduction of the VALIANT 40 continued, on a limited semi-custom scale, until 1992 when it was replaced by the VALIANT 42 model which shares the same hull.\r\nDespite the blistering problem on some of the early boats, the VALIANT 40 is one of the most highly thought of designs of this type and extremely successful, with more than 200 built.","rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"267.15","e":"13.60' /  4.15m","est-forestay-len":"53.59' /  16.34m","i":"50.30' /  15.33m","j":"18.50' /  5.64m","p":"45.00' /  13.72m","sa-disp":"15.09","safore":"465.28 ft2 /  43.22 m2","samain":"306.00 ft2 /  28.43 m2","totalcalcsa":"771.28 ft2 /  71.65 m2"},"rig-type":"Cutter","sa-disp":"15.09","updated":"2014-08-31T23:45:34.742Z"}
