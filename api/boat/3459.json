By 1958 it became the GALAXY 32 made by the American Boatbuilding Corp.  During the �60s they produced nine boats along with Beetle Boats who were reputed to have made several more. Coleman were also known to have contributed a few hulls. The American Molds were sold to Metalmast Marine who turned out 5 more boats in the early 70�s, and the last known manufactured GALAXY sat in their sheds until 1972, making theirs the final hull completed.
