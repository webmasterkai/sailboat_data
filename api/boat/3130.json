In 1967 Ericson produced 24 of these modeled after the COLUMBIA SABRE and called them the SCORPION 32. It was Ericson's original 32' yacht, sometimes called the ERICSON 32-I. It is nearly identical to the COLUMBIA presumably built using this same mold. Most had outboard wells though some were fitted with small inboards.","rig-type":"Fractional  Sloop","sa-disp":"18.27","see-also":[{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=386","text":"COLUMBIA SABRE"}}],"tanks":{"water":"15 gals. /  57 ltrs."},"updated":"2014-09-01T01:23:17.432Z"}
