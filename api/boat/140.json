McCune (later the builder of the YORKTOWN sailboats)  as a one-design class boat. \r\nSome 126 boats were built before the operation was sold to Wesco Marine in 1964. \r\nAnother model called the AURORA 21 had the same hull but with a larger cabin.\r\nChanges to the original design made by Wesco included making the cockpit self-bailing and installing a sliding hatch on the cabin. The cabin entrance was redesigned so it could be secured with a lock (hull#490-500)\r\nBetween 1969 and 1970, the boats were built by Coronado Yachts.  Later, production was resumed by Catalina Yachts  where it became the CAPRI VICTORY. \r\n","related-links":{"victory-21-site":{"link":"http://www.victory21.org","text":"www.victory21.org"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"178.57","e":"9.70' /  2.96m","est-forestay-len":"25.47' /  7.76m","i":"24.40' /  7.44m","j":"7.30' /  2.23m","p":"20.75' /  6.32m","sa-disp":"24.90","safore":"89.06 ft2 /  8.27 m2","samain":"100.64 ft2 /  9.35 m2","totalcalcsa":"189.70 ft2 /  17.62 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"24.94","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=3874","text":"AURORA  21"}},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
