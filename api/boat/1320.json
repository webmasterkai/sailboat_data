The molds were purchased by Endeavour at the company's founding and the design underwent a number of changes before being discontinued in 1982. \r\nThe earlier ENDEAVOUR 32's could be purchased with a fin keel or keel-centerboard (like the IRWIN). \r\nBy 1979, both the deep fin keel and keel-centerboard versions had been dropped in favor of a one shallower draft fixed keel model. Other differences between the earlier Irwin and the more cruising oriented Endeavour included changes to the cockpit coaming, coachroof and interior amenities. \r\nDennis Robbins was an in-house designer for Endeavour at this time.\r\nOther changes to the design (by Bob Johnson?) were made in 1980. Shown here is the last version.","related-links":{"endeavour-sailboat-owners":{"link":"http://www.endeavourowners.com","text":"www.endeavourowners.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"mast-height-from-dwl":"43.00' /  13.11m"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"14.46","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=1321","text":"IRWIN 32"}},"tanks":{"fuel":"20 gals. /  76 ltrs.","water":"65 gals. /  246 ltrs."},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
