In about 1965 South Coast took the molds and moved to a different location.  A hull was left behind which Kenner cut up, enlarged by a few inches, and re-faired to make molds for the KITTIWAKE.   \r\nSometime around 1970 the factory was sold to a conglomerate named AJ Industries which continued to produce Kittiwakes under the Kenner name.   \r\nIn 1973, Ray Greene and Co. of Toledo, OH bought the molds and built an unknown number of Kittiwakes until it ceased operation.     \r\nLater, River City Sailcraft obtained one or more molds and built an unknown number of Kittiwakes.  In 1978 the plant reportedly burned, and the molds were destroyed.","related-links":{"kittiwake-23-sailboat-registry":{"link":"http://www.kittiwake23registry.com","text":"www.kittiwake23registry.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"295.36","e":"10.50' /  3.20m","est-forestay-len":"28.87' /  8.80m","i":"27.50' /  8.38m","j":"8.80' /  2.68m","p":"24.00' /  7.32m","sa-disp":"16.56","safore":"121.00 ft2 /  11.24 m2","samain":"126.00 ft2 /  11.71 m2","totalcalcsa":"247.00 ft2 /  22.95 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"16.56","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=304","text":"SOUTH COAST 23"}},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
