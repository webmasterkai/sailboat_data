It was selected as the mono-type class for the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles. \r\nIn the 1940's, Edson Schock published the plans for a modified version in Rudder Magazine. After the Olympics, the SNOWBIRD became a popular boat for junior sailors in Newport Beach, CA. At some point, the class organizers made changes (from Reids original design) to the rig and rudder. W.D. Schock was asked to build the boat of fiberglass based on this latter modified version. (1961) Of these, 28 were built. Thanks to Jane Schock for providing updated information on this boat.\r\n","rig-type":"Cat","sa-disp":"63.63","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
