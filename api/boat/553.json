Despite the reverse transom, fin keel with spade rudder, the basic hull shape seems strikingly similar. At about this time, Hughes Boatworks acquired the tooling from Tanzer Industries, the original builder of NUTMEG 24. Little notice has been made of this since the NUTMEG/HUGHES 24 were not built in great numbers. The HUGHES 25, on the other hand, proved to be a very popular model.
