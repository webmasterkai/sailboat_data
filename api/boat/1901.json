About half of the 260 hulls built at the St. Catharines Ont. plant went to the U.S.  \r\nThe original interior has 2 quarterberths in a cabin just inside the companionway. The head and galley separate it from the main saloon which extends forward of the mast with the forepeak left as storage. In 1984, a second interior (The Encore) was in introduced. This featured a large double berth forward, separated from the main saloon by a head and shower. A u-shaped galley is located to port next to the companionway, with a quarterberth and nav station to starboard.  \r\nA Volvo 21-hp deisel was the standard auxiliary. Later, this was changed to a three-cylinder Volvo, or four-cylinder Westerbeke. The bowsprit was extended in 1985.","rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"329.47","e":"12.50' /  3.81m","est-forestay-len":"47.76' /  14.56m","i":"45.00' /  13.72m","j":"16.00' /  4.88m","p":"38.00' /  11.58m","sa-disp":"16.52","safore":"360.00 ft2 /  33.44 m2","samain":"237.50 ft2 /  22.06 m2","totalcalcsa":"597.50 ft2 /  55.51 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"16.53","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=7180","text":"NIAGARA 35 (ENCORE)"}},"updated":"2014-09-01T04:07:14.876Z"}
