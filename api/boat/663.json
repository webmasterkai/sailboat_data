Later, this shop added the Viking 22, 33 and a modified 33 renamed as the VIKING 34. The VIKING 28 was also built by Anesty Yachts in England and renamed the TRAPPER 28/400. Seventy of these were built along with a number of other C&C designs including the C&C 27, called the TRAPPER 27, and the C&C 35.  \r\nAlthough initially offered in kit form, many subsequent Vikings were professionally finished. A number of modifications to the design were made in 1974, and included the addition of a pop-top hatch and a wider companionway. At the same time, the mast step area and vee-berth were altered to strengthen the hull. The VIKING 28 was available with either an outboard engine in a well in the lazarette, or with a 7 hp Vire two-cycle gasoline inboard.","related-links":{"viking-28":{"link":"http://www.viking28.com","text":"www.viking28.com"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"200.20","e":"10.80' /  3.29m","est-forestay-len":"33.96' /  10.35m","i":"32.30' /  9.85m","j":"10.50' /  3.20m","p":"27.30' /  8.32m","sa-disp":"17.94","safore":"169.58 ft2 /  15.75 m2","samain":"147.42 ft2 /  13.70 m2","totalcalcsa":"317.00 ft2 /  29.45 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"17.94","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
