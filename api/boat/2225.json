Nearly half went directly to the charter trade.\r\nThis design underwent numerous modification during it's production life so dimensions, interior layouts and other details vary widely. \r\nSeveral auxiliary engines were used although the vast majority of boats came with Perkins diesel engines. Early models were powered by Perkins model 4-108 engines or the Westerbeke model 4-107. Morgan switched to Perkins 4-154 model engines later in production. Following Catalina Yacht's purchase of Morgan Yachts, the OUT ISLAND 41 CLASSIC was produced for several years using a Yanmar diesel engine.\r\nUsually rigged as a sloop or ketch.\r\nA keel/cb model was offered.
