In the beginning all hulls and superstructures were built in mahogany and had a fractional rig. At the end of the 50s a masthead rig replaced the fractional rig and the design of the main window was improved to two individual windows. As early as 1963 a GRP hull was introduced. At the same time the hull was made a bit wider.\r\nIn 1972 the transom was developed adding on her length from 8.61 m / 28'' 3'''' to 9.04 m / 29'' 8''''. After 1972 the deck was covered with teak as a standard and the toerail was made in teak in stead of mahogany. After Hull #500, boats were fitted with a Volvo Penta diesel. \r\nThe biggest markets for the P-28 were the USA and Sweden.","rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"16.53","tanks":{"fuel":"11 gals. /  42 ltrs.","water":"17 gals. /  64 ltrs."},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
