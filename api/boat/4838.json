The standard boat is 17'(5.18m) long though many 'stretched' 19' (5.8m) versions have been built. The original design was gunter rigged to facilitate trailing but over the years Bermudan, cutter, gaff and even junk rig variants have been used. Some later boats were built of fiberglass (by Febris Marine UK). Plans for the home builder are still available through the class association.","related-links":{"lysander-owners-assoc":{"link":"http://www.Lysander.org.uk","text":"www.Lysander.org.uk"}},"rig-type":"Gunter","sa-disp":"23.07","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
