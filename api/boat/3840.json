It began as a garage project by Richard Hill, and artist and auto industry model maker. The initial mold was made of plaster using an existing wood, hard chined racing sloop of unknown design as a plug. The resin used was actually called Vibrin, a material that was not available in large quantities during this time. After building a few boats for friends, production was turned over to Custom-Flex, a Toledo Ohio boat builder. A new, mold was made and a few additional boats were turned out in the mid-1960s.\r\n(rb-5/2008).\r\n","rig-type":"Fractional  Sloop","sa-disp":"12.23","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
