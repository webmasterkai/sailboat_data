(Thomas Flemming Day was editor of the publication at the time.) Designed originally as a centerboarder, Day converted his own SEA BIRD to a fixed keel before his celebrated Atlantic crossing. It is thought that several hundred have been built from the original SEA BIRD plans.","rig-type":"Gaff-Yawl","sa-disp":"26.65","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
