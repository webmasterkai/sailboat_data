It seems to have been a collaboration between Glas Laminates (a producer of spa's, outhouses, etc.) and Joseph H. McGlasson. McGlasson, designer and builder of a 24' wood sloop called the Catalina Islander and approached Glas Laminates about producing a fiberglass version. Using one of these boats as a plug, Glas Laminates pulled a mold and the Islander 24 was born. Evidently, the plug had \"v\" planking which gave the boat the look of a wooden boat which became an early Islander trademark.\r\nThe raised deck Bahama version proved to be far more popular and this trunk cabin model was discontinued after a comparatively short run.","rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"234.38","e":"11.50' /  3.51m","est-forestay-len":"30.00' /  9.14m","i":"28.80' /  8.78m","j":"8.40' /  2.56m","p":"25.80' /  7.86m","sa-disp":"16.60","safore":"120.96 ft2 /  11.24 m2","samain":"148.35 ft2 /  13.78 m2","totalcalcsa":"269.31 ft2 /  25.02 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"16.58","see-also":{"related-boat":{"link":"viewrecord.asp?class_id=384","text":"ISLANDER BAHAMA 24"}},"update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
