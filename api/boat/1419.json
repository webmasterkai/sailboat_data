'maxi' racer. This was the 30-30PC (Performance Cruiser). About 40 of these were produced. Ballast is 2310 lbs. and displacement about 6500 lbs.\r\nIn 1983 the factory introduced a Grand Prix Racing edition referred to as the GP. This model had a new, and apparently lighter deck. Ballast 2435 lbs., displacement 6000 lbs. 40 of these were built.  All boats built after 1985 have elliptical keels and rudders. The Performance Cruiser II has a number of modifications to the original Performance Cruiser. It has a Yanmar Engine. The chain-plates were moved outboard 3\" to allow the Number Three to be sheeted inside the shrouds. The interior has lower settee to allow for better headroom clearance under the deck.  The Plexiglas companionway cover was changed to fiberglass. Angle brackets were added to reinforce the bulkheads among other changes. All versions were delivered with the same rig.\r\nThanks to Jane Schock for providing drawing and updated information.","related-links":{"santana-30-30-class-association":{"link":"http://www.santana3030.org","text":"www.santana3030.org"}},"rig-dimensions":{"dl-ratio":"176.66","e":"11.10' /  3.38m","est-forestay-len":"42.44' /  12.94m","i":"40.80' /  12.44m","j":"11.70' /  3.57m","p":"36.20' /  11.03m","sa-disp":"20.26","safore":"238.68 ft2 /  22.17 m2","samain":"200.91 ft2 /  18.66 m2","totalcalcsa":"439.59 ft2 /  40.84 m2"},"rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"20.28","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
