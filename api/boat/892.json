The hull was stretched but beam is the same. Draft and ballast decreased, though the overall displacement remained the same. The rudder took on a higher aspect shape. Smoked acrylic port lights and small changes were made to interior detailing, but the layout is unchanged. Wheel steering became an option in 1976. Diesel power became an option in 1978. Near the end of the Mark III production run, the single-cylinder Yanmar SYP 12 diesel became standard.\r\nA shallow draft version was also available.
