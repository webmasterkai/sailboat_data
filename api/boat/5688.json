The PIONEER is said to be the first series-built glass fiber cruising yacht built in Europe. A prototype was built of wood that became the 'plug' for the first fiberglass version which was finished in the summer of 1959, just in time to participate in the Flevo Race of that year. Van de Stadt sailed the race himself and finished first in class. \r\nThanks to 'Gerard' and Jan Derks for supplying this information. \r\nThe PIONIER 9 was also built in the UK, molded by Tyler Boat Co, and finished by Southern Ocean Shipyard.","rig-type":"Masthead Sloop","sa-disp":"16.02","update":{"deleted":0,"errors":0,"inserted":0,"replaced":1,"skipped":0,"unchanged":0}}
