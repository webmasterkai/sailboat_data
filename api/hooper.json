The deck is wide and safe contained with lifelines and railings.  Beneath the water is a modified fin keel, a skeg on skeg stern section and a spade rudder that is deep down.  The waterline is long and there’s little compromise between performance, comfort and maeuverability.  This is a nice boat with lots of recent upgrades.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:21.021Z","year":"1977"},{"color":"White w/lt blue nonskid","colorStripe":"Blue","file":"2730","id":"1386","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_1386.jpg","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_01.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_02.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_03.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_04.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_05.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_06.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_07.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1386_08.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=1386","text":"View More Images"},"keel":"Fin","loa":"28'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"22' 3\"","manufacturer":"Ouyang Boat Works","model":"ALOHA 8.5  (28')","name":"Rose Bud","price":"$11,500.00","rig":"Sloop","specs":"14 HP Westerbeke Inboard Diesel w/12 gallon fuel tank<br>Mainsail w/blue Cover<br>150% Furling Genoa<br>150% Hank on Genoa<br>105% Jib<br>90 Jib<br>Boom Vang<br>Roller Furling Unit (not installed, but included)<br>Harken Traveler<br>Tiller w/cover<br>2 Barlow 19 ST Winches w/2 handles<br>2 Barlow 16 Halyard Winches<br>1 Barient 8 Winch<br>Compass w/inclinometer<br>Tiller Auto Pilot<br>Knot Meter/Log<br>Depth Sounder<br>VHF Marine Radio<br>WSI<br>Misc Safety Gear<br>Manual &amp; Auto/Electric Bilge Pump<br>Bow &amp; Stern Rail w/Lifelines<br>Stern Mounted Swim Ladder<br>30A Shore Power w/50&#x2019; cord<br>12v Dual Battery Electrical System<br>110v Battery Charger<br>AM/FM/CD/Sat Radio<br>2 Burner Stove &amp; Oven (LPG)<br>Manual Fresh Water System w/22 gallon tank<br>Top Loading ice box<br>Deck Washdown Pump w/Hose<br>Marine Head w/13 gallon holding tank<br>25# CQR Anchor w/rode &amp; chain<br>Danforth Anchor w/rode &amp; chain<br>Anchor Roller<br>Pulpit Anchor Holder<br>Deck Anchor Locker<br>4+ DockLines<br>4 Boat Fenders<br>Boat Hook<br>Trailer extra money<br>","text":"The Aloha 27 is an interesting Robert Perry design.

It was purchased from the original owner/builder, who personally (and meticulously) oversaw the worker’s who custom built this vessel.  The hull was purchased from Westsail in 1977 and was under continuous construction until launch in September of 1984. The fiberglass hull is reinforced with 2“ ribs on 16“ centers with areas between the ribs filled with foam and then covered with layers of fiberglass mat. Beneath the waterline an additional layers of woven roving was also added. The vessel is very well equipped and has extensive custom features and custom wood and metal work of stainless steel and bronze. Custom stainless steel fittings on deck include bow pulpit, stern rail and lifelines stanchions. There is a safety harness attachment system that runs completely around the perimeter of the outside caving roof. This system consists of custom stainless steel pipe that allows the use to clip into it on either side of the cockpit, then go forward completely around the deck and return to the opposite side of the cockpit without having to unclip the safety harness. A custom stainless steel accessory arch is built aft over the helmsman’s seat and accommodates radar, nav, VHF and SSB antennae, air horn, overhead VHF and speakers, a loud hailer and bell. There also is a wooden swim platform on the transom. The interior has extensive custom woodwork, inlcuding tongue and groove bulkheads and overhead ceilings, inlaid drawer faces and a teak and holly chart table. The port navigation station is built-in, with a pull out chart drawer beneath.  There is also an inside steering station with overhead ports for visibility aloft. The galley features a sink on a center island. This boat is built for serious offshore sailing, but is a fresh water vessel.  Designed by WIB Crealock, she has a double-spreader sloop-rig with Tanbark sails. She sails like a dream. The boat is currently being used in Lake Superior, but the aging owners are getting out of sailing.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:21.043Z","year":"1983"},{"color":"White Deck & Green Hull","file":"2760","id":"1403","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_1403.jpg","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1403_01.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1403_02.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1403_03.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1403_04.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1403_05.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1403_06.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1403_07.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=1403","text":"View More Images"},"keel":"Centerboard","loa":"16'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"14' 9\"","manufacturer":"ABBOTT BOATS","model":"WAYFARER 16","name":"Bittergreen","price":"$4,250.00","rig":"Fractional Sloop","specs":"2000 Karavan Trailer in good condition<br>Mainsail w/reef points<br>Storm Jib<br>Working Jib<br>Tri Sail<br>Halyards replaced in 2005<br>Jib sheets replaced in 2000<br>Spinnaker w/Pole<br>2 winches (were removed for refinishing &amp; not on now)<br>Boom Tent<br>9&#x2018; spoon blade oars<br>","text":"There were 8,400 hulls built of this design by two companies – Abbott Boats and Hartley Boats out of Canada.

She has sleeping accommodations for 4 on new cushions that are 6’9” long and there’s a head you can get at without disturbing any sleeping family members. The mast is hinged on the deck for easy stepping. The fin keel provides stability and great windward performance. Mirage Yachts Ltd. was formed in February of 1972 by Dick and Irene Steffen,for the purpose of building the Mirage 24 designed by C&C.Dick and Irene owned a large volume C&C dealership in Point Claire, Quebec. Atthe time C&C did not build any model smaller than the 27. Dick was a very keenracing sailor and wanted a smaller MORC boat to both sail and sell from hisretail dealership. At his request the C&C had designed a 24-footer, but thedecision by the production management was made not to build or market it.Steffen then bought the 24 design from the C&C design office and set up hisown shop on the second floor of a rented building in Point Claire, Quebec tobuild it.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:20.996Z","year":"1975"},{"color":"White w/tan nonskid","file":"2552","id":"1223","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_1223.jpg","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1223_01.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1223_02.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1223_03.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1223_04.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1223_05.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1223_06.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1223_07.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=1223","text":"View More Images"},"keel":"Full","loa":"23'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"16' 3\"","manufacturer":"C E RYDER CORPORATION","model":"SEA SPRITE 23","name":"Matchen","price":"$7,500.00","rig":"Fractional Sloop","specs":"Honda 2.5 HP 4 Stroke Outboard<br>2 North Mainsails (200 &amp; 2005)<br>Quantum 2007 Blade (excellent)<br>Quantum 150% Genoa (2000)<br>Quantum 2000 Spinnaker<br>North 2002 Spinnaker<br>Spinnaker Pole<br>Boom Vang 8:1<br>Harken Traveler w/WW Sheeting Car<br>2 Winches &amp; 4 handles<br>Tiller w/Cover<br>Folding Anchor<br>2 Boat Fenders<br>4 Dock Lines<br>","text":"Designed by Carl Alberg and built most recently by C.E.

Through the years they produced quality cruising and racing vessels. By the early '80s, C&C had established itself at the forefront of the sailing industry, from both sailing results and business standpoints. Its success on the racecourse continues today. Originally a Rhode Island boat, this boat (Pocho) was purchased used in 2003 and sailed in 2004 to the Hudson River and then in 2005 was sailed through the Great Lakes by a gentleman who unexpectedly passed away in 2008. She now has been recently commissioned in the water on Lake Superior. She sleeps 7-8 crew/family members in a cabin with full standing headroom and new upholstery.  Practically everything on this boat, in terms of equipment, has been replaced and is new, but there is a little unfinished work to be done and most of it is straight forward. The engine was rebuilt in 2004 and new mounts added. The starter and water pump were also replaced. The strut was rebedded and the cutlass bearing replaced as was the prop. The transmission seals are new. Shift cables were tended to. Misc hoses replaced as needed. There is a new control panel and wiring. The fuel tank has been cleaned and new filters added. She runs extremely well.  All the brightwork has ten coats of varnish.  The teak interior is quite beautiful.  The mast has been rigged and stepped. The fresh water system has been plumbed and works with the exception of the manual pump which is a minor fix. The head works well and is plumbed.  All of the photos are before the most recent work has been completed. More up to date photos will come soon. There is teak and holly flooring in the cabin, but the photos do not show them.  In 2001 Pocho won the Heinechen Regatta in Sint. Maarten.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:21.038Z","year":"1980"},{"color":"Off White","colorStripe":"Brown","file":"2573","id":"1240","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_1240.jpg","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_01.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_02.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_03.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_04.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_05.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_06.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_07.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_08.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1240_09.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=1240","text":"View More Images"},"keel":"Fin","loa":"25'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"22' 1\"","manufacturer":"HUNTER MARINE","model":"HUNTER 25.5","name":"Hysteria","price":"$6,500.00","rig":"Sloop","specs":"1985 Evinrude Outboard w/3 gallon tank<br>Shorelander Tandem Trailer<br>Mainsail w/red cover (good condition)<br>Bower&#x2019;s Mainsail (well worn)<br>80% Bowers Working Jib (good condition)<br>110% Bowers Genoa (well worn)<br>120% Bowers Genoa (slight wear)<br>140% Bowers Genoa (slight wear)<br>Spinnaker (hardly used)<br>Whisker Pole<br>Boom Vang<br>4 Winches w/6 handles (Primaries Self Tailing)<br>Tiller Steering<br>Bow &amp; Stern Rail w/Lifelines<br>Transom Mounted Swim Ladder<br>Standard Horizon Depth Sounder<br>Standard Horizon Knot Meter/Log<br>Unimetrics VHF Marine Radio&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>12v Electrical System&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>2 Burner Alcohol Stove <br>Top Loading Ice Box<br>Manual Fresh Water System<br>Danforth Anchor, galvanized chain &amp; 60&#x2019; rode<br>Deck Anchor Locker<br>4 Boat Fenders &amp; 6 Dock Lines<br>Fire Extinguisher<br>6-8 PFD&#x2019;s<br>Horn<br>Auto Electric Bilge Pump<br>Boom Tent<br>Cockpit Cushions<br><br><br>","text":"This generation Hunter is nice sailing design.

The L-Shaped galley is aft of the dinette and on the starboard side there is a quarter berth. The hull is solid fiberglass with full keel and attached rudder. The deck and cockpit consist of ½” epoxy coated marine plywood .has a super structure with 5 opening side ports and skylight on top. The decks now are much improved from the original.  The spars are hollow Sitka Spruce with 1x19 SS rigging, turnbuckles & toggles.  She’s a cruising delight at an affordable price.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:21.035Z","year":"1976"},{"color":"Gray","colorStripe":"Yellow","file":"1","id":"1227","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_1227.jpg","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1227_01.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_1227_02.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=1227","text":"View More Images"},"loa":"12'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"' \"","manufacturer":"AVON","model":"AVON REDCREST INFLATABLE DINGHY","price":"$500.00","rig":"No sail rig","specs":"Inflatable<br>Motor Mount<br>Thwart Seats<br>Bow Cover (yellow)<br>Boat Cover (yellow)","text":"This is an affordable tender and can be easily folded up and stowed away.  It comes with a yellow boat cover and yellow bow cover.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:20.971Z","year":""},{"color":"White","colorStripe":"Blue","file":"2","id":"1283","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_1283.jpg","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1283_01.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_1283_02.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=1283","text":"View More Images"},"keel":"Inflatable","loa":"7'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"' \"","manufacturer":"MERCURY","model":"MERCURY 240 AIRDECK HYPALON DINGHY","price":"$1,000.00","rig":"N/A","specs":"Oars<br>Fiberglass seat<br>Repair Kit<br>Inflator Pump<br>Tow Bridle<br>Storage Bag<br>Registration Plaques<br>","text":"Here’s an inflatable with sleek styling and plenty of interior room with a comfortable rowing position.

Built to race and cruise, the J/30 is a fast and dry sailing vessel that out-sails the average 30 footer and keeps up with 35-40 footers. Her fractional rig and tapered mast allow for easier headsail handling with controls that allow the headsail to perform over a wider range of wind velocities. Ten Seven has been completely refinished on the exterior.  The hull has been painted with Awlgrip. The deck was opened up and wet core was replaced and the entire deck was Awlgripped and a new white on white nonskid applied.  The teak handrails were replaced with modern SS handrails and the teak toe rails were replaced with the white polycarbonate toe rails and the coaming trim replaced with composite too. New windows were installed and deck hardware was upgraded to modern Harken gear. The bottom has been completely stripped and resealed with an epoxy barrier coat. The keel and rudder were faired and VC17 racing bottom applied. The Headfoil was removed and a new Furlex roller furling system was installed.  The mast and boom were painted as well and all new halyards, topping lift and running rigging are new too. This boat rocks.  Below, in a beautiful hand-crafted interior, she has 5’11” headroom, sleeping accommodations for 6 (2 in the bow, 2 in the main salon & 2 quarter berths aft) on Navy blue cushions (in great condition). This boat has the optional center table with drop leafs and teak and holly sole. There is a private head, vanity & hanging locker between the forepeak and main cabin and the galley is situated to port at the companionway and across the top loading ice box and combo chart table nav station is dedicated.  The cockpit will seat 6 to 8 people.  Two early J/30’s survived the dreaded famous Fastnet Race where boats and sailors were lost at sea. One commented after a knockdown and hanging on for 14 hours in extreme conditions, they didn’t take any water in below except for an occasional spray through the louvered companionway board.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:21.026Z","year":"1981"},{"color":"White Deck w/beige nonskid & dark blue hull","colorStripe":"White & Gold","file":"1913","id":"993","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_993.JPG","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_01.JPG","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_02.JPG","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_03.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_04.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_05.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_06.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_07.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_mp/UsedBoats_993_08.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=993","text":"View More Images"},"keel":"Full","loa":"32'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"22' 0\"","manufacturer":"HOLLANDIA SHIPYARD","model":"RHODES SLOOP 32","name":"Panacea","price":"$44,000.00","rig":"Fractional Sloop","specs":"1980 30 HP Universal Atomic 4 Gas inboard w/1&#x201D; SS shaft, 3 bladed 10&#x201D; bronze prop w/20 gallon fuel tank <br>&amp; electric fuel pump<br>Cradle<br>Mainsail w/dark blue cover &amp; roller reefing boom<br>Working Jib<br>Storm Jib<br>2 Genoas<br>Merriman #2 Primary Winches<br>Barlow #2 Main Halyard Winch<br>Merriman #1 Jib Halyard Winch<br>Traveler<br>Constellatoin Compass<br>West marine VHF Marine Radio<br>Datamarine Knot Meter<br>Maxxima AM/FM Cassette Player<br>Inclinometer<br>Chelsea Barometer<br>Chelsea Chronometer<br>Galley w/SS Ice Box &amp; hand pump from 20 gallon tank<br>SS Counter Tops<br>12v Electrical System<br>30 Amp Shore Power w/new AC panel (2001)<br>Wilcox Crittenden &#x201C;Winner&#x201D; Head &amp; 9 gallon holding tank<br>Jabsco Macerator &amp; RC Marine Y Valve<br>Carbon Monoxide Detector<br>Engineroom Blower<br>AC Fuel Filter<br>Danforth 9# Anchor w/300&#x2019; &#xBD;&#x201D; rode &amp; 5&#x2019; of 3/8&#x201D; chain<br>Danforth 9# Anchor w/150&#x2019; of &#xBD;&#x201D; rode &amp; 5&#x2019;of 1/4&#x201D; chain<br>Fortress FX16 (no rode or chain)<br>Dorade Vents w/chrome vents<br>Windlass<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;","text":"This is a Philip L. Rhodes stock design, number c634, hull #3, built in the Netherlands, by Hollandia Shipyard in Woubriugge, Netherlands and originally named as Temptress. She was imported by Reisinger Marine Sales Co. in Tappahonnock, VA. She has a full keel with cutaway forefoot, with the attached rudder hung on the keel. The cockpit has shallow lockers port and starboard and a lazerette aft. The trunk cabin is stepped and the foredeck uncluttered. Access to the cabin is via hinged, louvered doors. Below there are settees port and starboard, with an ice box on the port side near the main bulkhead and a galley sink on the starboard side. There is stowage bins beneath the settees, and lockers outboard. The cushions are either recovered or remanufactured. The companionway steps are removable to provide access to the engine room. There is an enclosed head compartment forward of the main salon on the starboard side and a hanging locker opposite. There is a V-berth forward with water and holding tanks beneath as well as storage. There is an overhead hatch for ventilation. The hull is built of clear 7.8” African mahogany, with edge glued seams above the waterline and caulked below – fastened with bronze screws and plugged. Select steam bent white oak 1-1/4” square beams are on 9” centers with SS strapping at hard bends. The transom is select African mahogany, double planked construction. The interior is mahogany varnished and the bulkheads are mahogany painted. The decks are marine hardwood plywood. Shelves are Oregon Pine. Carlins are white oak heartwood. Cabin sides, toe rails, coamings, hatches, seats, trim are African mahogany. Cockpit sole & bridgedeck is teak. The stern, keel, sternpost, floors, knees, deadwood are select white oak heartwood. The hull, including the iron ballast and the topsides, have been fiberglassed with a layer of mat, roving and cloth set in WEST System epoxy. The decks and cabin structure have been treated similarly without the layer of mat. The cockpit has been glassed but not before the rubrail and toerail were removed. The hull above the waterline and the entire deck have been Awlgripped in the fall of 2008. A new beige nonskid was applied. All exterior brightwork has been cleaned, sanded and treated with Sikkens Cetol. All deck hardware (cleats, rubbing strakes, trim, chocks, vents, etc.) have been re-chromed and installed on the deck with new caulking in the fall of 2008. In addition, the large ports (4) typical of Rhode’s boats in the main salon are new. The mast is a 7/8” fractional rig built hollow of Sitka Spruce and painted. It is deck stepped. A condition and evaluation survey was completed in August of 2001. It was deemed satisfactory and now a great deal of additional work has been completed. This is a stunning boat with a beautiful, timeless exterior finish guaranteed to turn heads.","updated":"2014-09-08T18:11:21.032Z","year":"1957"},{"color":"White","colorStripe":"Red & Blue","file":"1914","id":"997","img":"http://www.hoopersyachts.com/Links/UsedBoats_997.jpg","imgs":["http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_997_01.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_997_02.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_997_03.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_997_04.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_997_05.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_997_06.jpg","http://hoopersyachts.com/images_MP/UsedBoats_997_07.jpg"],"imgsLink":{"link":"UsedBoatsMoreImages.cfm?PageID=997","text":"View More Images"},"keel":"Shoal Fin","loa":"27'","located":"Hooper's Yachts","lwl":"21' 9\"","manufacturer":"CATALINA YACHTS","model":"CATALINA 27","price":"$7,900.00","rig":"Sloop","specs":"Universal Atomic 4 Inboard (30 HP) \\<br>w/Racor LG50 Fuel/Air Separator Filter<br>Mainsail w/Blue Cover<br>150% Furling Genoa<br>Furlex Furling 100S Unit (2002)&#xA0;&#xA0;<br>Primary Winches w/handle<br>Compass<br>Midland 78-350 VHF Marine Radio<br>GPS Map 130<br>Auto Tiller Pilot ST100+<br>Sparfly<br>Misc Safety Gear<br>Auto/Electric Bilge Pump<br>Bow &amp; Stern Rails w/Lifelines (newer)<br>SS Transom Mounted Ladder<br>Cockpit Cushions<br>30A Shore Power w/Cord<br>Dual Battery 12v Electrical System<br>Galley w/Fresh Water System<br>WC Headmate SeacloMarine Head w/holding tank<br>Lectra-San Waste Treatment System<br>Head Sink<br>Anchor, rode &amp; chain<br>Misc Dock Lines &amp; Fenders<br>Boat Hook<br>","text":"This is the traditional Catalina interior with a table that folds up onto the bulkhead when not in use.

And, the lifelines have been recently replaced.  The Catalina 27 is a nice cruising vessel with a good sized interior for a 27-footer with stand up headroom for most. There is sleeping for five with the double forepeak and settee berths in the main salon – one of which folds out to a nice sized double.  The owners have moved into a newer Catalina and are having some cosmetic work completed on this boat to have her ready for a new owner.  This is a fresh water boat on her 3rd owner.
